Getting erro when running docker ps -a on ubuntu after installation of docker 

Error: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.39/containers/json?all=1: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

To create the docker group and add your user:

    1) Create the docker group.
        $ sudo groupadd docker
    
    2)  Add your user to the docker group.
        $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    
    Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.
    If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.
    On a desktop Linux environment such as X Windows, log out of your session completely and then log back in.

    3) On Linux, you can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:
       $ newgrp docker 
    4) Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.
       $ docker run hello-world
